# ML_project_2
CS-433 project 2

This project aims to classify real and fake sequences of proteins. The raw data file that we used is located in the data folder and it is called NoGapsMSA_SIS1-on-top.fasta.
Ultimatelly, we achieved an F-score of 0.96. To recreate this result, and all other less impressive results that you can read about in the report, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository
- Install all the dependencies in requirements.txt by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the preprocessing function two times, once with false_per_true = 1 and once with false_per_true = 4. You can also use different ratios, but you will then have to update the FOLDERS const in CONSTS.py with the new file paths. 
- Run the entire main function in main.py to produce the results. 

&nbsp; 

Below is a brief overview of how the python files are used, but see the report and the commented functions for further details.

### Main.py
Main function for running the preprocessing, training and testing.

### classifier.py
Contains all the models that we used:
- Neural network with one hidden layer
- Neural network with two hidden layers
- Logistic regression

### model_utils.py
In this file, we have all the helper functions for the training and testing of the models. 

### preprocessing.py 
This function contains all the functions we use to extract the raw data and save the real and fake sequences to seperate files. These functions also ensure randomizing the extraction.

### training.py
This function both train the model and test it while trining. The results from the testing are saved as plots. See our report for examples. 

### utils.py
General helper functions. Mostly for file manipulation such as appending and reading files.

&nbsp; 

Precise descriptions of the functions and their required input is given at the beginning of each function.
